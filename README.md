# Challenge-Marking-up-a-letter
HTML Letter Markup Challenge â€” A semantic HTML structure exercise based on MDN Web Docs. This project replicates a formal letter layout using proper tags like &lt;address>, &lt;time>, &lt;abbr>, &lt;dl>, and more, to enhance accessibility and readability. A great hands-on practice in semantic markup and content structure!
